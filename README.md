# UniswapV3Oracle

This package contains a beta version of an oracle which uses UniswapV3Oracle to get pricing data.
This is experimental code. The original uniswap V3 code is not compatible with solidity v0.8 & above. This project contains files from Uniswap V3 which were modified to work with solidity v 0.8.0. You can see the differences for each file at the following links.
